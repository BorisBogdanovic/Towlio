# Towlio ‚Äì Full-Stack Developer Portfolio

This is a full-stack portfolio project developed using **Laravel (backend)** and **React (frontend)**.

The application simulates a platform where a business owner can invite vendors to offer towing services, monitor their performance, and manage sales operations.  
While the project is fictional, it demonstrates my ability to build and manage a real-world full-stack application with user roles, performance tracking, and business logic integration.
